# JK-Flip-Flop
Digital Logic Design: JK Flip Flop with Verilog in Xilinx Vivado.    

This repository contains the implementation of a JK flip flop using Verilog and Xilinx Vivado. The JK flip flop is a fundamental building block in digital logic circuits and is widely used in sequential logic design.
## Overview
The implementation is done in Verilog hardware description language (HDL).
The JK-Flip Flop is designed to be reconfigurable and can be easily modified for different counting requirements.
Simulation and testing were performed using Xilinx Vivado 2021.2.
## Contents
The src directory contains the Verilog source code for the JK-Flip Flop.
The sim directory includes the simulation files and test bench code.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository: 
    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/SamarthWalse10/JK-Flip-Flop.git
2. Open the project in your preferred Verilog development environment.
3. Compile and synthesize the Verilog source code.
4. Simulate the design using the provided test bench.
5. Analyze the simulation results and verify the functionality of the JK-Flip Flop.
